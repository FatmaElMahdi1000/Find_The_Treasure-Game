The ground beneath you crumbles away  
like sand slipping between your fingers.

There’s no time to scream —  
only the rush of wind tearing past your skin,  
pulling you deeper into the unknown.

Shapes twist in the darkness:  
faces, shadows, glimmers of light — gone before you can focus.

A pulse of light flares below.

Then: 

***CRASH****

Cold stone bites into your skin.  
The air smells of wet rock, iron, and something old.  
You push yourself up, heart hammering.

Whispers drift like smoke across the walls.

You are not alone. On the top of that, SUPER CONFUSED!." """,
